# Welcome!

Welcome to the team!

## Mindset / Philosophy

We believe that having a great and happy team leads to great outcomes. Building a project like this should be fun and fulfilling as well as productive so together we are working on implementing a set of practices that will lead to great outcomes.

Let's start with the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

Writing great software is a journey not a destination. These ideas help us to orient ourselves through a storm.

Other important values we espouse:

- As best we can within the limitations of our space we orient ourselves towards [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)
- Test driven development helps us design our code for flexability [Red green refactor](https://www.codecademy.com/article/tdd-red-green-refactor)
- We should tackle technical debt as soon as practical unless we make deliberate strategic decisions to take it on. This is especially true for accidental technical debt.

## Choose your task

Tasks are marked as priority in up next can be taken on as required. You do not need to be a code owner or expert within the code to choose to take on a task. If you want to work on a task claim it and work on it. We are a remote team so if you can work out answers to your problems from the code do so. If you need help ask for it. Communicate your blockers and strategy every day during standup.

## T-shaped developer

You should be prepared to work within all parts of our codebase to help out with feature delivery. You have been hired because you have a deep technical skill but you should be able to help with simple things outside of your area of speciality.
